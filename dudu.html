<p>Babies are in fact born without any kneecaps â€“ they have a structure made of cartilage that resembles a kneecap, but they don't fully develop until around 6 months of age. Most people assume that babies born in January will be the heaviest because of all the feasting over Christmas and New Year.</p>
